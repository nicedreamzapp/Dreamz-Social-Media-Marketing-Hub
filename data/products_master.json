Perfect balance of performance and compatibility. 5mm Pearls: Excellent for large bangers (30mm+) and when maximum heat retention is desired. Mixed Sizes: Combine different sizes for unique heat distribution patterns and enhanced movement. Usage Instructions Getting Started with SIC Pearls: Initial Cleaning: Rinse pearls with isopropyl alcohol before first use Placement: Drop pearls into your banger or insert before heating Heating: Heat your banger as normal – pearls will heat up with the surface Dabbing: Add your concentrates and watch the pearls create movement Airflow: Use a carb cap to create airflow that spins the pearls Care & Maintenance Keeping Your SIC Pearls in Perfect Condition: After Each Use: Allow pearls to cool completely before handling Regular Cleaning: Soak in isopropyl alcohol to remove residue buildup Deep Cleaning: Use cotton swabs with alcohol for detailed cleaning Torch Cleaning: SIC can handle direct flame cleaning if needed Storage: Store in a clean, dry container to prevent contamination Inspection: Check for chips or cracks regularly (though SIC rarely damages) SIC vs Other Materials Why Silicon Carbide outperforms other pearl materials: vs Quartz Pearls • Better heat retention • Higher thermal conductivity • More durable construction vs Ruby Pearls • More affordable • Easier to clean • No risk of chipping vs Glass Pearls • Superior heat resistance • Won’t break from thermal shock • Better chemical inertness Complete Your Setup Enhance your dabbing experience with these complementary products: 🔥 Core Erig Parts Complete your Core Erig setup with replacement parts and accessories for optimal performance. 🔧 Shop Core Erig Parts → 💎 30mm Inserts SIC and Quartz inserts perfect for use with your new pearls.

    "description": "v4 & v5 Bottomless Quartz Banger and Bubble Carb Cap These are the newly revised bottomless quartz banger that will fit the v4 and v5. Now sold in both 90° & 45° options. You will notice the quality of this bottomless quartz banger the second it arrives — smooth, clean, and made with quality. Outer diameter of banger is 25mm. Options include: Bottomless quartz banger by itself Bottomless quartz banger with bubble carb cap Bottomless quartz banger with aluminum carb cap and two 4mm SIC terp pearls Bottomless quartz banger with titanium carb cap and two 4mm SIC terp pearls We recommend using the bottomless banger (bb) on a flat wide table with a dab mat, leaving yourself enough room for anything to happen. Leave yourself enough room to work since there are many moving pieces with your bb setup. When removing your device from the bb, we always recommend holding from the base of the banger walls and the metal base of the heater you are using. Then remove the bb vertically with a small twist. Do not remove at an angle — otherwise you will crack the banger walls. DO NOT HOLD THE BANGER BY THE STEM. ALWAYS HOLD FROM THE BOWL. Always be sure your o-rings fit tight — the fit should never be loose. Never force the base if the o-rings appear too tight or you may break the banger. Email us about any sizing issues. Due to mishandling, we will only guarantee these bangers up to 1 week. 🔗 Compatible Accessories Glass Dabber Carb Cap by itself Aluminum Carb Cap Magnetic Breakaway Extension Cables SiC Terp Pearls Affordable Dab Rig Perfect Dab Tools Additional Questions or Concerns ❓ 📺 Watch tutorials on YouTube or join the Reddit Forum 📧 Email matt@ineedhemp.com with any questions 💬 Join us on Discord #BottomlessQuartzBanger #DivineTribe #DabTools",

Perfect for conscious consumers, they offer unmatched comfort and sustainability. Hemp’s natural strength ensures longevity, while its UV-resistant fibers protect against sun exposure, making these hoodies ideal for outdoor adventures. 🌿👕 🏥 Health Benefits of Hemp Hemp hoodies are hypoallergenic and mold-resistant, perfect for sensitive skin. Their breathable, insulating fibers keep you warm yet comfortable in any season. Hemp’s natural antimicrobial properties reduce odor without chemicals, ensuring freshness during active use. Unlike cotton, hemp retains vibrant colors and resists pilling, offering a soft, skin-friendly fit that improves with wear. 🌬️🛡️ 🌍 Why Choose Hemp? Hemp is a sustainable powerhouse, requiring 50% less water than cotton and no pesticides, reducing environmental impact. Its high-yield crops produce more fiber per acre, supporting eco-conscious fashion. Historically, hemp’s versatility made it a staple for textiles, but 20th-century prohibition limited its use due to regulatory confusion with cannabis. Now, with legalization, hemp’s superior durability, moisture-wicking, and eco-friendly properties make it a top choice over traditional materials like polyester, which lacks breathability and biodegradability. Choose hemp to support a greener planet and enjoy long-lasting, comfortable clothing. ♻️🌱 🎨 Colors & Sizes Available Colors Reactive Black 🖤 Coral Blue 🌊 Dark Brown 🤎 Workout Grey 🏋️‍♂️ Mossy Green 🌿 Size Chart Size Length Width Sleeve Small 21″ 23″ 26″ Medium 23″ 24″ 27″ Large 26″ 26″ 29″ XL 27″ 26″ 30″ XXL 29″ 27″ 30″ 📋 Care & Maintenance Washing Instructions Machine wash cold to preserve fibers 🧼 Use eco-friendly detergent 🌿 Tumble dry low or air dry ☀️ Softens with each wash 👕 Durability Benefits Softens over time, stays comfortable 🧶 Maintains shape after washes 🛡️ Resists fading and shrinking 🎨 Long-lasting sustainable fashion 🌍 🛒 Ordering & Discounts Specify sizes/colors in checkout notes for multiple orders.

    "title": "Divine Crossing XL v5 Rebuildable Concentrate Heater",
    "description": "✨ Divine Crossing XL v5 Ceramic Heater ✨ 🔥✨ Check out the Divine Crossing XL V5 Rebuildable Concentrate Heater 🔥✨ We took everything you love about the original V5 and made it even better. The XL ceramic heater cup fits right onto your existing setup, so there’s no hassle. Thicker leads mean it’s tougher, and the taller metal top boosts airflow for those smooth, flavorful hits you crave. Plus, the bigger cup walls make cleanup a breeze – no more splashing! 🧼 🌀 Upgrade Further with an All-Glass Vortex Top Each kit includes a complementary glass top specially designed for the XL cup, we prefer a 14mm glass vortex top with a 4mm tube which will be added to the order unless otherwise specified. 🪟 This top enhances your experience with optimized airflow. If you’d prefer a different option, let us know when placing your order. 📝 For those looking to customize further, you can also opt for extra glass vortex top. It takes airflow up a notch, giving you an even better experience. Go ahead, make your V5 the best it can be! 🚀 ⚠️ Instructions & Maintenance Take Immediate Caution: Ceramic heater cups can reach temperatures of up to 600°F and may cause serious burns. Please be careful when handling the unit. 🔥 Each part can be replaced, and the entire unit can be rebuilt. There is no need to discard the whole assembly if one part breaks; we designed it with eco-friendly concepts in mind. 🌿 The V5 side and bottom heated ceramic cup with vortex airflow is temperature-controlled, making it the most effective way to conserve and experience concentrates while allowing for maximum vapor at the lowest temperatures. 💨 🔋 Take Note of Battery/Mod Settings Wattage: 27-37W (Pulsing button) 💡 TCR Value: 200, using 36W to reach 500°F 🌡️ Ultimately, you will want to practice to get the best experience. Some mods produce more power than others at the same settings. To preserve the side and bottom heated ceramic cups, start at a low setting and gradually work your way up to find a happy middle ground of flavor and clouds. ☁️ 📖 How to Use Always keep your O-rings clean and lubricated with a vegetable oil of your choice. This makes it easier to remove the top. Place a small amount (2-5 hits max) of concentrate into the side and bottom heated ceramic cup. Keep the unit upright throughout the entire session; do not tip it, or the concentrate will pour out of the cup. Press the button on the mod to start heating the cup and allow the concentrate to boil and vaporize. Now draw slowly; this will allow for maximum vapor and conserve concentrates in the cup from splashing out. Make sure to maintain heat on the cup so that vapor is produced throughout the session. Sessions should not exceed one minute. ⏱️ Keep the temperatures low enough to avoid burning the concentrates to a char (dry). 🔥 Always use a Q-tip to clean the cup after each session to maintain cleanliness and performance. Wipe down and clean the glass top while it’s still warm to avoid reclaim buildup in the vapor pathway. Allow the unit to cool down for 3 minutes before the next session. 🧼 🔧 Installing and Maintaining Your Ceramic Heater Under the right settings, both the standard and XL cups should last a long time. When a ceramic heater cup goes out or the resistance rises, you can replace it by unscrewing the two screws that hold the cup’s lead wires fastened to the deck. Loosen the screws, gently pull out the cup, and remove it. 🔩 Every now and then, you’ll want to burn off residue on the cup. Set your mod to 38W in wattage mode (this can be less for some mods; always start low and see). Hold the unit upside down while delivering only two minutes of heat to the cup, then STOP and allow it to cool completely before the next cleaning session. 🧼 🎁 Kit Includes Complete XL v5 assembled (ready to go) 🚀 1 extra XL v5 side and bottom ceramic heater cup 🔄 1 extended all steel v4 top 🛠️ Dab tool 🧰 4 extra screws, tool and o-rings 🔩 Cotton swabs and alcohol wipes 🧼 Instruction Manual 📜 🌐 Additional Questions or Concerns ❓ Be sure to check out our YouTube channel for instructional videos.
