✨ Hemp Hoodies ✨ 55% Hemp, 45% Organic Cotton 🌿 🌟 Sustainable Style & Comfort Our hemp hoodies blend 55% hemp fleece and 45% organic cotton for eco-friendly, durable wear. Perfect for conscious consumers, they offer unmatched comfort and sustainability. Hemp’s natural strength ensures longevity, while its UV-resistant fibers protect against sun exposure, making these hoodies ideal for outdoor adventures. 🌿👕 🏥 Health Benefits of Hemp Hemp hoodies are hypoallergenic and mold-resistant, perfect for sensitive skin. Their breathable, insulating fibers keep you warm yet comfortable in any season. Hemp’s natural antimicrobial properties reduce odor without chemicals, ensuring freshness during active use. Unlike cotton, hemp retains vibrant colors and resists pilling, offering a soft, skin-friendly fit that improves with wear. 🌬️🛡️ 🌍 Why Choose Hemp? Hemp is a sustainable powerhouse, requiring 50% less water than cotton and no pesticides, reducing environmental impact. Its high-yield crops produce more fiber per acre, supporting eco-conscious fashion. Historically, hemp’s versatility made it a staple for textiles, but 20th-century prohibition limited its use due to regulatory confusion with cannabis. Now, with legalization, hemp’s superior durability, moisture-wicking, and eco-friendly properties make it a top choice over traditional materials like polyester, which lacks breathability and biodegradability. Choose hemp to support a greener planet and enjoy long-lasting, comfortable clothing. ♻️🌱 🎨 Colors & Sizes Available Colors Reactive Black 🖤 Coral Blue 🌊 Dark Brown 🤎 Workout Grey 🏋️‍♂️ Mossy Green 🌿 Size Chart Size Length Width Sleeve Small 21″ 23″ 26″ Medium 23″ 24″ 27″ Large 26″ 26″ 29″ XL 27″ 26″ 30″ XXL 29″ 27″ 30″ 📋 Care & Maintenance Washing Instructions Machine wash cold to preserve fibers 🧼 Use eco-friendly detergent 🌿 Tumble dry low or air dry ☀️ Softens with each wash 👕 Durability Benefits Softens over time, stays comfortable 🧶 Maintains shape after washes 🛡️ Resists fading and shrinking 🎨 Long-lasting sustainable fashion 🌍 🛒 Ordering & Discounts Specify sizes/colors in checkout notes for multiple orders.
