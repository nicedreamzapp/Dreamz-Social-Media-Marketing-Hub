✨ Divine Crossing XL v5 Ceramic Heater ✨ 🔥✨ Check out the Divine Crossing XL V5 Rebuildable Concentrate Heater 🔥✨ We took everything you love about the original V5 and made it even better. The XL ceramic heater cup fits right onto your existing setup, so there’s no hassle. Thicker leads mean it’s tougher, and the taller metal top boosts airflow for those smooth, flavorful hits you crave. Plus, the bigger cup walls make cleanup a breeze – no more splashing! 🧼 🌀 Upgrade Further with an All-Glass Vortex Top Each kit includes a complementary glass top specially designed for the XL cup, we prefer a 14mm glass vortex top with a 4mm tube which will be added to the order unless otherwise specified. 🪟 This top enhances your experience with optimized airflow. If you’d prefer a different option, let us know when placing your order. 📝 For those looking to customize further, you can also opt for extra glass vortex top. It takes airflow up a notch, giving you an even better experience. Go ahead, make your V5 the best it can be! 🚀 ⚠️ Instructions & Maintenance Take Immediate Caution: Ceramic heater cups can reach temperatures of up to 600°F and may cause serious burns. Please be careful when handling the unit. 🔥 Each part can be replaced, and the entire unit can be rebuilt. There is no need to discard the whole assembly if one part breaks; we designed it with eco-friendly concepts in mind. 🌿 The V5 side and bottom heated ceramic cup with vortex airflow is temperature-controlled, making it the most effective way to conserve and experience concentrates while allowing for maximum vapor at the lowest temperatures. 💨 🔋 Take Note of Battery/Mod Settings Wattage: 27-37W (Pulsing button) 💡 TCR Value: 200, using 36W to reach 500°F 🌡️ Ultimately, you will want to practice to get the best experience. Some mods produce more power than others at the same settings. To preserve the side and bottom heated ceramic cups, start at a low setting and gradually work your way up to find a happy middle ground of flavor and clouds. ☁️ 📖 How to Use Always keep your O-rings clean and lubricated with a vegetable oil of your choice. This makes it easier to remove the top. Place a small amount (2-5 hits max) of concentrate into the side and bottom heated ceramic cup. Keep the unit upright throughout the entire session; do not tip it, or the concentrate will pour out of the cup. Press the button on the mod to start heating the cup and allow the concentrate to boil and vaporize. Now draw slowly; this will allow for maximum vapor and conserve concentrates in the cup from splashing out. Make sure to maintain heat on the cup so that vapor is produced throughout the session. Sessions should not exceed one minute. ⏱️ Keep the temperatures low enough to avoid burning the concentrates to a char (dry). 🔥 Always use a Q-tip to clean the cup after each session to maintain cleanliness and performance. Wipe down and clean the glass top while it’s still warm to avoid reclaim buildup in the vapor pathway. Allow the unit to cool down for 3 minutes before the next session. 🧼 🔧 Installing and Maintaining Your Ceramic Heater Under the right settings, both the standard and XL cups should last a long time. When a ceramic heater cup goes out or the resistance rises, you can replace it by unscrewing the two screws that hold the cup’s lead wires fastened to the deck. Loosen the screws, gently pull out the cup, and remove it. 🔩 Every now and then, you’ll want to burn off residue on the cup. Set your mod to 38W in wattage mode (this can be less for some mods; always start low and see). Hold the unit upside down while delivering only two minutes of heat to the cup, then STOP and allow it to cool completely before the next cleaning session. 🧼 🎁 Kit Includes Complete XL v5 assembled (ready to go) 🚀 1 extra XL v5 side and bottom ceramic heater cup 🔄 1 extended all steel v4 top 🛠️ Dab tool 🧰 4 extra screws, tool and o-rings 🔩 Cotton swabs and alcohol wipes 🧼 Instruction Manual 📜 🌐 Additional Questions or Concerns ❓ Be sure to check out our YouTube channel for instructional videos.
