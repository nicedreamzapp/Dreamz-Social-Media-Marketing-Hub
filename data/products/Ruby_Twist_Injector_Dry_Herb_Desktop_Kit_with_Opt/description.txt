✨ Ruby Twist Kit – The Ultimate Herbal Diffusing Experience 💎 Meet the Ruby Twist , the latest upgrade in innovative vaporizing technology. Designed with a ruby-filled reservoir and a Twist airflow system, this device delivers fast vapor production, exceptional flavor, and unmatched versatility for both high loads and micro-doses. 🚀 Unlike traditional devices that rely on a single heating element to produce vapor, the Ruby Twist utilizes hundreds of superheated ruby balls, each acting as a miniature heat source. This design allows the air to flow through multiple contact points, heating it more evenly and efficiently. The air is also diffused through the ruby matrix, ensuring consistent temperature distribution for smooth, flavorful vapor. 🌡️ The vortex airflow system eliminates the need for stirring or tamping and allows for smooth, flavorful hits at lower temperatures (515-626°F ≈ 270-330°C). 🌬️ Key Features Gemstone Ruby Reservoir – Smooth, consistent vapor production Vortex Airflow – No stirring, even vaporization Titanium Housing – Durable and lightweight Temp Range – 515–626°F (270–330°C) Fully Assembled – Plug and play operation 0.05g – 0.4g Range – From micro to macro dosing 🎁 What’s Included? 💎 Ruby Twist Injector with gemstone-cut rubies inside for superior performance 🔥 Titanium Housing with 20mm Heater Coil and silicone handle 🟢 Glass Bowl (0.4g max capacity) with side-carb for enhanced control 🔌 PID Controller (Celsius/Fahrenheit switchable) for precision temp control 🔧 Heat Guard, Steel Stand, Scoop & Tamper Tool, and Wood Cleaning Brush 🛡️ Spare Screens and Keck Clip to keep your kit secure 🛠️ Warranty Info Enjoy peace of mind with a one-year warranty on the PID controller and Heater Coil.
