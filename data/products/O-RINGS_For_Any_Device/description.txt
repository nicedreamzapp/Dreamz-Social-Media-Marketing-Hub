O-Rings â€“ Any device This listing is for o-rings for any device we carry. Please select which ones you need from the drop down. If what you need is not listed, please select the Not Listed option. Be sure to be as specific as you can in the Checkout Notes as to what you need. If your V4 has a serial number of 0 to 750, then please ask for the smaller green orings. The serial number can be found on the bottom of your atomizer. We have upgraded the V4 base orings to green machining ones. They are much more durable and will have a longer life. $3 is for the cost of shipping Additional Questions or Concerns Be sure to check out our YouTube page for instructional videos.
