How SIC Pearls Improve Your Experience Silicon Carbide pearls revolutionize your dabbing sessions by: Creating Movement: Pearls spin and roll, continuously mixing your concentrates for even vaporization Extending Heat: Superior thermal mass keeps your banger at optimal temperature longer Reducing Waste: More efficient heat distribution means less material left behind Lowering Temperatures: Better heat retention allows for lower temperature dabbing Improving Flavor: Lower temps and inert material preserve terpene profiles Size Selection Guide Choosing the Right Size for Your Setup: 3mm Pearls: Best for small bangers (under 20mm), crucibles, and tight spaces. Minimal airflow restriction. 4mm Pearls: Ideal for standard 25mm bangers and most inserts. Perfect balance of performance and compatibility. 5mm Pearls: Excellent for large bangers (30mm+) and when maximum heat retention is desired. Mixed Sizes: Combine different sizes for unique heat distribution patterns and enhanced movement. Usage Instructions Getting Started with SIC Pearls: Initial Cleaning: Rinse pearls with isopropyl alcohol before first use Placement: Drop pearls into your banger or insert before heating Heating: Heat your banger as normal – pearls will heat up with the surface Dabbing: Add your concentrates and watch the pearls create movement Airflow: Use a carb cap to create airflow that spins the pearls Care & Maintenance Keeping Your SIC Pearls in Perfect Condition: After Each Use: Allow pearls to cool completely before handling Regular Cleaning: Soak in isopropyl alcohol to remove residue buildup Deep Cleaning: Use cotton swabs with alcohol for detailed cleaning Torch Cleaning: SIC can handle direct flame cleaning if needed Storage: Store in a clean, dry container to prevent contamination Inspection: Check for chips or cracks regularly (though SIC rarely damages) SIC vs Other Materials Why Silicon Carbide outperforms other pearl materials: vs Quartz Pearls • Better heat retention • Higher thermal conductivity • More durable construction vs Ruby Pearls • More affordable • Easier to clean • No risk of chipping vs Glass Pearls • Superior heat resistance • Won’t break from thermal shock • Better chemical inertness Complete Your Setup Enhance your dabbing experience with these complementary products: 🔥 Core Erig Parts Complete your Core Erig setup with replacement parts and accessories for optimal performance. 🔧 Shop Core Erig Parts → 💎 30mm Inserts SIC and Quartz inserts perfect for use with your new pearls.
