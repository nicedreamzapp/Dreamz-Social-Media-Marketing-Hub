You will notice the quality of this bottomless quartz banger the second it arrives — smooth, clean, and made with quality. Outer diameter of banger is 25mm. Options include: Bottomless quartz banger by itself Bottomless quartz banger with bubble carb cap Bottomless quartz banger with aluminum carb cap and two 4mm SIC terp pearls Bottomless quartz banger with titanium carb cap and two 4mm SIC terp pearls We recommend using the bottomless banger (bb) on a flat wide table with a dab mat, leaving yourself enough room for anything to happen. Leave yourself enough room to work since there are many moving pieces with your bb setup. When removing your device from the bb, we always recommend holding from the base of the banger walls and the metal base of the heater you are using. Then remove the bb vertically with a small twist. Do not remove at an angle — otherwise you will crack the banger walls. DO NOT HOLD THE BANGER BY THE STEM. ALWAYS HOLD FROM THE BOWL. Always be sure your o-rings fit tight — the fit should never be loose. Never force the base if the o-rings appear too tight or you may break the banger. Email us about any sizing issues. Due to mishandling, we will only guarantee these bangers up to 1 week. 🔗 Compatible Accessories Glass Dabber Carb Cap by itself Aluminum Carb Cap Magnetic Breakaway Extension Cables SiC Terp Pearls Affordable Dab Rig Perfect Dab Tools Additional Questions or Concerns ❓ 📺 Watch tutorials on YouTube or join the Reddit Forum 📧 Email matt@ineedhemp.com with any questions 💬 Join us on Discord #BottomlessQuartzBanger #DivineTribe #DabTools
